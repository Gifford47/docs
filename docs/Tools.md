# Useful tasmota Tools

## ESP-Flasher for Tasmota
SP-Flasher is a utility app for ESP8266 / ESP32 and is designed to make flashing Tasmota on ESPs as simple as possible by:
- Having pre-built binaries for most operating systems.
- Hiding all non-essential options for flashing. All necessary options for flashing (bootloader, flash mode) are automatically extracted from the binary.

The flashing process is done using the esptool library by espressif.
